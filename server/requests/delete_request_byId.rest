# DELETE a resource by id (REST Client examples)
@baseUrl = http://localhost:3001

### Quick example — delete id 1
DELETE {{baseUrl}}/api/notes/1
Accept: application/json

### Variable id example
@id = 695b97e37243a62352556a61
DELETE {{baseUrl}}/api/notes/{{id}}
Accept: application/json

# cURL equivalent (run in a terminal):
# curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/notes/1

# Notes:
# - Replace the port or path if your server listens elsewhere.
# - In VS Code, use the REST Client extension to run these requests directly from this file.

# HTTP/1.1 204 No Content — what it means

# 204 No Content means:

# ➡️ The DELETE request succeeded
# ➡️ The resource was deleted successfully
# ➡️ There is nothing to return in the response body

# In other words:
# 🗑️ The note with ID 69500d7ef71f7a542288ee14 is now deleted

# This is exactly the correct status code for a successful DELETE in REST APIs.
